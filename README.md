# Portfolio Website – Min Soe Htut  

A modern personal portfolio website built with **Next.js 15**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, showcasing my professional journey, technical projects, and software development skills.  
This website acts as both a **digital résumé** and a **project showcase**, featuring animations, responsive design, and theme consistency.

## Overview  

This website was designed to present my **academic and professional experience**, along with highlights of my featured projects.  
I built this portfolio using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS because I wanted to challenge myself to go 
beyond traditional HTML and CSS development. TypeScript helps me write cleaner, more reliable, and maintainable 
code with type safety. Next.js provides a modern framework for fast, scalable React applications with server-side 
rendering and easy deployment. Tailwind CSS allows me to design efficiently with a consistent, responsive style system.
I focused on tools that would help me grow as a developer and build real-world, production-ready projects.

### Key Sections  
- **Home** – Hero introduction with my photo, about text, and quick navigation links.  
- **Journey** – Interactive timeline combining academic and work experience with dynamic highlights.  
- **Projects** – Grid layout featuring major projects with repository links.  
- **Skills** – Organized by technology stack with interactive icons and hover effects.  
- **Contact** – Clickable icons linking to email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
